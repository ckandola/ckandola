ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ckandola
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software testing and development, particularly involving Javascript, React, and Jest. 
I have been known to break a lot of interfaces just because I tried to do something that wasn't supported, 
so I'm very interested in learning to build interfaces that are both understandable and robust against naive users like me.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning software testing with Jest. I tried Mocha, but wanted to learn about the advantages of snapshots,
which helps in my React developing.
- ðŸ’¼ I'm currently working as a cash office clerk while searching for local or remote software development opportunities. 
I would love to be able to see and work with a team, but remote opportunites are great as well, since they allow for more
flexibility.
- ðŸŽ® I like to play video games in my free time, but very relaxed ones like Animal Crossing. Actually, that one is occupying a 
lot of my free time right now.
